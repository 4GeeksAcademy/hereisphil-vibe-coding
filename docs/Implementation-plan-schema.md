# Implementation Plan AI Usage Guide

This document serves as a **living implementation record** for the project.  
It defines all planned and completed features, milestones, and technical steps required to reach and evolve the MVP.

---

## AI Interaction Rules

1. **Always read this file before beginning any new feature or code change.**  
   Use it to understand what features exist, their current status, and dependencies.

2. **When adding a new feature:**

   - Duplicate the Feature Implementation Plan Model shown below.
   - Replace all placeholder fields (`[Feature Name]`, etc.) with real details.
   - Insert the new feature under the appropriate section (MVP, Post-MVP, or Other).
   - Maintain consistent formatting.

3. **When updating progress:**

   - Update the **Status** field.
   - Check off relevant items in **Implementation Steps** and **Acceptance Criteria**.
   - Update the **Last Updated** date.
   - If implementation details evolve, expand the Technical Breakdown or Testing Notes.

4. **When completing a major milestone (e.g., MVP deployment):**

   - Add a short summary entry at the bottom under Development Notes describing what changed or was achieved.

5. **Do not delete or overwrite past feature sections.**
   - Instead, mark them as Complete and update the timestamp.
   - This document should reflect a chronological record of development history.

## Feature Implementation Plan Model

Use this exact structure when creating or updating feature entries.

### Example Template

## Feature: [Feature Name]

**Purpose:**  
_Describe the intent and reason for this feature._

**User Story / Use Case:**  
_As a [user type], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve benefit]._

**Dependencies / Prerequisites:**  
_List related systems, APIs, libraries, or other features required before this one can function._

**Technical Breakdown:**

- _Frontend components/pages to build_
- _Backend endpoints or database tables needed_
- _Key logic or architectural notes_

**Implementation Steps:**

- [ ] Step 1: _Define or set up structure_
- [ ] Step 2: _Build primary functionality_
- [ ] Step 3: _Integrate with data sources or APIs_
- [ ] Step 4: _Add validations/tests_
- [ ] Step 5: _UI/UX refinements_

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] _Feature works as intended_
- [ ] _No errors in console/build_
- [ ] _Responsive layout verified_
- [ ] _Feature integrated with related systems_

**Testing & Validation Notes:**  
_Specify how to test functionality and what tools to use._

**Post-Implementation Actions:**  
_Follow-ups such as documentation, styling, or refactoring._

**Status:** Not Started / In Progress / Blocked / Complete  
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Implementation Sections

Below are the main phases of implementation.  
Each section contains **reserved space** where the AI (or a developer) should insert detailed feature entries using the model above.

---

## MVP Features

> _Core functionalities required to achieve a Minimum Viable Product._

<!--
    Insert feature implementation plans for all MVP-level features here.
    Each feature entry should follow the Feature Implementation Plan Model.
-->

---

## Post-MVP Enhancements

> _Additional features, polish, and quality-of-life improvements planned after MVP deployment._

<!--
    Insert Post-MVP feature implementation plans here.
-->

---

## Experimental / Optional Features

> _Experimental or stretch features for exploration or testing._

<!--
    Insert optional or experimental features here.
-->

---

## Deployment & Integration Tasks

> _Steps for hosting, MCP setup, and production pipeline configuration._

<!--
    Insert deployment or infrastructure-related feature entries here.
-->

---

## Development Notes

> _Chronological updates, milestones, or reflection logs (AI or developer-written)._

<!--
    Use this section to summarize development sessions, bug fixes, or major updates.
    Example: "2025-10-10  Completed MVP login flow; integrated Supabase + Clerk."
